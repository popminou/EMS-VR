Starbox
=======

Thank you for purchasing Starbox!  Starbox is the only skybox made with 100% real stars, each in its correct position, with size, color, and brightness based on real astronomical data.

Starbox currently comes with two sizes: "Starbox1024" uses 1024x1024 pixel images, while "Starbox2048" uses 2048x2048 pixel images.

Directions
==========
Use Starbox like any other skybox:

1. Choose one of the materials (Starbox1024 or Starbox2048), or create your own material with a skybox shader, and assign the six images to it.  The Starbox images follow the standard skybox naming conventions: forward, right, back, left, up, and down.

2. Use the Edit > Render Settings command in Unity to select your chosen material as the skybox material.

3. In the properties for your main camera, make sure "Clear Flags" is set to "Skybox".
